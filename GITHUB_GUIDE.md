# 🐙 GITHUB PLATFORM GUIDE

You successfully pushed your code! Now, here is how to use **GitHub**.

## 1. View Your Code 🔍
**Your Repository URL:**
👉 **https://github.com/deepak25000000/govoptima-hackathon**

1.  Click the link above.
2.  You will see all your files (`main.py`, `README.md`, etc.).
3.  This proves your code is safe in the cloud!

## 2. Make It Look Professional (For Hackathon) 🏆
Add a description so judges know what this is.

1.  Look at the **About** section on the right side of your repo page.
2.  Click the **⚙️ (Gear icon)** next to "About".
3.  **Description:** Paste this:
    > "GovOptima: AI-Powered Government Resource Allocation & Migration Analytics Platform - Hackathon 2026 Submission"
4.  **Website:** (Leave empty for now, or add your Render URL later).
5.  Click **Save changes**.

## 3. How to Submit 📝
When the hackathon asks for your "Code Repository":
- Copy the URL from your browser address bar:
- `https://github.com/deepak25000000/govoptima-hackathon`

## 4. GitHub vs. Render (Important) 💡
- **GitHub** is like "Google Drive" for code. It **stores** your files.
- **Render** is the "Computer". It **runs** your files (the website).

**Next Step:** Connect this GitHub repo to Render to turn the code into a live website.
